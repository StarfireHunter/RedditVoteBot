This bot was written in python using praw.  The bot will first ask for your bot's reddit username and password.  The bot asks the user for a target username as well as asking if the user wants to mass upvote or downvote.  The user will then be asked if they want to run the bot continuously or not.  The bot will then upvote or downvote all of a user's comments and print a permalink to the downvoted or upvoted post.  The bot will run continously or exit, depending on the option selected, after upvoting/downvoting all of a user's comments.
